							<h6>1. Sell Your Course Before All Your Content Is Created</h6>
							<p>Before we start breaking down our course idea into sections and lectures, know that you should never create all of your content before you sell your course. Surprised? So are most of our Teachers (and so was I!). The idea is this, when you sell your course you will start to get feedback from students about your content. This can be things like if you speak too quickly in videos, if your lighting is off, if your microphone is too soft. You’ll also hear good things, like areas where students want to hear more information, or things they love within your course.</p>
